# Hand-track snake game with YOLOv8 object detection

## Overview
Explore AI by developing a Snake game integrated with hand tracking control using Yolov8 and Pygame, showcasing a practical application of AI in game development.

1. **realtime_handtrack.py**: Train a hand tracking model with the YoloV8 model using a dataset that can be created from webcam/video footage.
2. **extract_vdo2im.py**: Utility script for extracting images from video to create training data.
3. **snake_control.py**: Play the Snake game using mouse control, demonstrating basic game interaction.
4. **main.py**: The main application that combines hand tracking with the Snake game, transitioning control from mouse to hand tracking.
5. **realtime_snake_demo.py**: A backup of main.py for code safety.
   
Dataset: A collection of images for training the hand tracking model, essential for personalizing control interactions.
